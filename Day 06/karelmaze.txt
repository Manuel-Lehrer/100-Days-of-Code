This was the solution to the final maze of the Karel Bot:

def turn_around():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
def turn_right():
    turn_around()
    turn_left()

while not at_goal():
    if front_is_clear() and right_is_clear():
        move()
	# if you were put a turn_left() here to always have a wall to the right of you, this would not work since we are
	# inside the loop, and it would not turn right when it has to since this covers 2 scenarios.
	# If you where to create a second while loop before this with if front is clear
	# then move and turn left it would work like in angelas version
    else:
        if right_is_clear():
             turn_right()
             move()
        elif front_is_clear():
            move()
        else:
            turn_left()
